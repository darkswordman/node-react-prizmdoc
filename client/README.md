### build and preview
Run `npm run build:vite` and then `npm run preview` to test the production build with vite

### Run local development
- Run `npm run dev` to test with vite. Not all changes on the previewer settings are reactive, so a manual browser refresh is required
- Should start the server with `npm run start` too
